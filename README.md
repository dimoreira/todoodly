An simple and beautiful **todo** app build with RoR (Ruby on Rails).

It's open sourced for small teams that need a self deployed solution for integrate with mobile applications.

## TODO

I've been constructing some API endpoints for external use with an iOS application. Anyone is welcome to help ;)

The iOS app is being developed yet and will be *githubed* soon.
